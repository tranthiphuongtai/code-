            Note: The animation-duration property defines how long time an animation should take to complete. If the animation-duration property is not specified, no animation will occur, because the default value is 0s (0 seconds).

            In the example above we have specified when the style will change by using the keywords "from" and "to" (which represents 0% (start) and 100% (complete)).

            It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many style changes as you like.

            The following example will change the background-color of the  element when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete
